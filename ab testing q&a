What is A/B Testing?
It's an experimental method used to compare two versions of something to see which one performs better against a defined goal.

Why using A/B Testing?
1. it helps the company to make data-driven decisions and not just rely on guesswork or opinions.
2. it can help the company better understand the users by analysing how they bahave to the certain changes, and from there the user experience could be optimized properly.

How to design A/B Testing?
1. set the goal, with a clear hypothesis.
2. choose the metrics to measure the result. it includes primary metric to decide success, secondary metric to support, and guardrail metrics that not harm.
3. create the control and treatment user groups, usually randomly splited 50/50.
4. run the test long enough to get statistical power and analyze the result by using t-test or chi-test.
5. decide whether to implement the change.

How to choose the right sample size for A/B Testing? How to calculate?
Use power analysis formulas to calculate the right size, so regardless of p-value, the enough data are used to make a good decision.
n is sample size per group
n = ((Z(1-alpha/2) + Z(1-beta))^2 * sigma^2) / delta^2

What is the p-value?
The p-value is the probability of obtaining results at least as extreme as the ones observed, assuming the null hypothesis is true.
  a. if the p-value < 0.05, the null hypothesis can be rejected and the result is statistically significant.
  b. if the p-value >= 0.05, there is not enough evidence to reject the null hypothesis.

What is the alpha?
The alpha is the significance level, which indicate the probability of type 1 error (the rejected null hypothesis is actually true, false positive in confusion matrix).
  - when alpha is lower, the confidence level of the result is higher and the uncertainty is lower, which means sample size should be larger.

What is the beta?
The beta is the probability of type 2 error (the null hypothesis is failed to rejected while the alternative hypothesis is true, false negative in confusion matrix).
  - beta = 1 - power, power is the probability that we want to reject the null hypothesis, common power level is 80%.

What is the delta?
The delta is the minimum detectable effect(MDE), the gap between the null hypothesis and the alternative hypothesis you care about.
  - the smaller delta want to detect, the larger the sample size will be needed.

What is the sigma?
Then sigma is standard deviation of the distribution, which indicates how noisy the metric is.
  - the larger sigma means much bigger sample is needed to detect delta.

What is the test result is not statistically significant?
It means there is not enough evidence to say that the treatment group is better than the control group.

What are common pitfalls in A/B Testing?
1. not randomizing correcting, which can lead to bias.
2. wrong metric selection.
3. not running long enough to avoid seasonallity or get enough data.
