# A/B Testing Case Study

## How to increate Youtube watch time (end to end plan)?

**1.Define the goal and hypothesis**  
Let's say the change is redesigning the "next up" thumbnails to autoplay personalized user's recent watch history rather than the current generic content. The goal is to increase the average watch time per unique user over a 24hrs session for 2 minutes with the baseline 20 minutes. So the hypothesis is personalized autoplay thumbnails will increase the average watch time per user over a session by 10%.
- Null hypothesis: personalized autoplay thumbnails would not extend the watch time of users per session.  
- Alternative hypothesis: with the personalized autoplay thumbnails, the average watch time increased by at least the MDE.

**2.Create or choose the right metrics**  
The primary metric is the average watch time per unique user over a 24hrs session.  
The secondary metrics can be the CTR on the "next up" thumbnails, the numbers of videos watched per session and session RPM.
The guardrail metric can be user compliants, unsubscribe rate and increase in errors.

**3.Select the population and calculate the sample size**
Randomly assign users into the A or B groups. Use power analysis to calculate the effective sample size.
